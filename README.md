Linear regression with Keras

Linear regression is a machine learning method used to predict a continuous value from a set of data. In Keras, linear regression can be configured to solve a variety of problems, such as:

Price prediction: It can be used to predict the price of a product or service based on its features.
Sales prediction: It can be used to predict the number of units of a product sold based on factors such as marketing and advertising.
Risk prediction: It can be used to predict the risk of a customer defaulting on a loan based on their financial characteristics.
Keras provides a variety of tools and features to configure and train linear regression models. To configure a linear regression problem, you first need to define a training dataset containing the features and the target values. Then, you can use the Keras API to create a linear regression model.
